##  Mid Project Report
10/10/16
Group 3 - Inna Turshudzhyan, Nick Louie, Satoe Sakuma, Brett Moretzky

###  Required elements
You need to provide sufficient evidence that you have thought through how to complete the project, and that I can use to assess the appropriateness of its scope and technical merits. To this end, your report topic should contain:

###  Description
A brief description of the project you are planning to complete, including your group number, the members of your group, your chosen project, and a preliminary explanation of what you plan to implement in enough detail that I can assess the potential success of the project.
###  References

A list of the five most relevant references that you have found to the background you need for the project. Ideally, these references should be from high-quality, reputable sources (books with known publishers, peer-reviewed papers, established conferece proceedings, specification pages of well-established companies) - not from unreviewed or weakly reviewed web content (e.g. wikipedia). They should also be specific enough to be useful (e.g. "Wall Street Journal, October 5, 2016, Twitter Sale Nears As Bids Come Due " rather than just "The Wall Street Journal").
###  Schedule
A tentative schedule of goals and deadlines leading up to the projectâ€™s completion, and the envisioned role of each person in the group. Although some members may have managerial or documentation roles, every member must also have a substantive technical contribution to the project.

### Technical content
What are the interesting cybersecurity technical challenges involved in bringing this project to completion. Assign qualitative estimates (e.g. fake percentages) for each challenge describing how confident you are that you will be able to meet the challenges. There should be at least some challenges that you are 100% confident that you will complete them (if not, pick some easier challenges), and some that you are less than 100% confident that you will complete.

### Comments
A place at the bottom of the topic, where I can provide feedback as appropriate.
